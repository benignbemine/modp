What we covered today:

1.) What is an elliptic curve. What does it look like over the real numbers.

An elliptic curve is a curve defined by the function y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. When graphed over the real numbers, these curves can take on many shapes based on how a and b are chosen. Here are a few examples of how elliptic curves look:

For the Bitcoin protocall, there is one specific elliptic curves on which ALL users rely. You may have heard of it: Secp256k1. It is defined by y^2 = x^3 + 7.

Here is a graph of it over the real numbers.

2.) What is a prime field. What does an elliptic curve look like graphed over a prime field.

A prime field Fp consists of the set of integers from 0 to (p-1) under the operations of mod-p addition and multiplication. For example, F7 is the set of integers {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} under mod7 addition and multiplication.

For the bitcoin protocall, p = 2^356 - 2^32 - 2^9 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1.

As you can imagine, graphing an elliptic curve over a prime field looks significantly different than over the reals. A prime field contains a finite number of elements, so instead of a continuous line, we see a scattering of dots.

Also, not every element in the prime field will result in a solution to the elliptic curve equation (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b). The set of points in the prime field Fp looks like this:

(0,0) (0,1) ... (0,p-1)
(1,0) .........
...............
...............
...............
(p-1,0)........ (p-1,p-1)

Taking each one of these points and plugging them into our elliptic curve equation (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b) we see which ones will yeild solutions. Those that do will be included in the graph of the elliptic curve over the prime field.

Note, for every point (x,y) that is a solution to the elliptic curve, the  corresponding point (x, -y modp) is also a solution! This is because y^2 == (-y)^2 mod p.

Below, pictured is an elliptic curve graphed over a prime field. You can see that for each x which yeilds a solution to the curve modp, there is also another corresponding point for the same x! These pairings are reflections of eachother over the line y=p/2, i.e. the graph is symmetric about the line y=p/2.
