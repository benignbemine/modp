What we covered today:

1.) What is an elliptic curve. What does it look like over the real numbers.

An elliptic curve is a curve defined by the function y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. When graphed over the real numbers, these curves can take on many shapes based on how a and b are chosen. Here are a few examples of how elliptic curves look:

For the Bitcoin protocol, there is one specific elliptic curve on which ALL users rely. You may have heard of it: secp256k1. It is defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 7.

Here is a graph of it over the real numbers. Note how the curve is continuous.

2.) What is a prime field? What does an elliptic curve look like graphed over a prime field?

Given a prime number p, the prime field Fp consists of the set of integers from 0 to (p-1) under the operations of mod-p addition and multiplication. For our purposes just think of this as the set of integers from 0 to (p-1). For example, F7 is the set of integers {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.

The prime field used for key generation in the bitcoin protocol is the set of integers from 0 to (p - 1), where p = 2^356 - 2^32 - 2^9 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1 (~1 gagillion).

What does it mean to plot the curve over a prime field?

When plotting over real numbers, we solved the equation y^2 = x^3 + 7 for all real numbers. In other words, we check every x value to see if we can solve for y. We then plot these (x, y) pairs on the chart to create the continuous curve you saw above.

In contrast, when plotting over a prime field, we check for solutions to y^2 = x^3 + 7 only for integers in Fp. In other words, we use every x value in Fp (integers from 0 to (p-1)) and solve y^2 = x^3 + 7 for y. If y is also in Fp, then this (x, y) pair is a solution to the equation.

(0,0) (0,1) ... (0,p-1)
(1,0) .........
...............
...............
...............
(p-1,0)........ (p-1,p-1)

As you can imagine, an elliptic curve plotted over a prime field looks significantly different than an elliptic curve plotted over the real numbers. A prime field contains a finite number of elements, so instead of a continuous line, we see a scattering of dots.


Here is why:

The set of points in the prime field Fp looks like this. The x and y coordinates each range from 0 to (p-1):


Not every element in the prime field will result in a solution to the elliptic curve equation (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b).

Taking each one of these points and plugging them into our elliptic curve equation (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b) we see which ones will yeild solutions. Those that do will be included in the graph of the elliptic curve over the prime field.

Note, for every point (x,y) that is a solution to the elliptic curve, the  corresponding point (x, -y modp) is also a solution! This is because y^2 == (-y)^2 mod p.

Below, pictured is an elliptic curve graphed over a prime field. You can see that for each x which yeilds a solution to the curve modp, there is also another corresponding point for the same x! These pairings are reflections of eachother over the line y=p/2, i.e. the graph is symmetric about the line y=p/2.




3.) How does elliptic curve addition work over a prime field?
