      <h2>What we covered today</h2>

      <p>
        1.) What is an elliptic curve. What does it look like over the real numbers.

      <p>
        An elliptic curve is a curve defined by the function y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + ax + b. When graphed over the real numbers, these curves can take on many shapes based on how a and b are chosen. Here are a few examples of how elliptic curves look:

      <p>
        For the Bitcoin protocol, there is one specific elliptic curve on which ALL users rely. You may have heard of it: secp256k1, a curve developed and standardized by NIST. It is defined by the equation y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + 7.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a graph of it over the real numbers. Note how the curve is continuous.

        2.) What is a prime field? What does an elliptic curve look like graphed over a prime field?
      </p>

      <p>
        Given a prime number p, the prime field Fp consists of the set of integers from 0 to (p-1) under the operations of mod-p addition and multiplication. For our purposes just think of this as the set of integers from 0 to (p-1). For example, F7 is the set of integers {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.
      </p>

      <p>
        The prime field used for key generation in the bitcoin protocol is the set of integers from 0 to (p - 1), where p = 2<sup>356</sup> - 2<sup>32</sup> - 2<sup>9</sup> - 2<sup>7</sup> - 2<sup>6</sup> - 2<sup>4</sup> - 1 (~1 gagillion).
      </p>

      <p>
        What does it mean to plot the curve over a prime field?
      </p>

      <p>
        When plotting over real numbers, we solved the equation y^2 = x^3 + 7 for all real numbers. In other words, we check every x value to see if we can solve for y. We then plot these (x, y) pairs on the chart to create the continuous curve you saw above.
      </p>

      <p>
        In contrast, when plotting over a prime field, we check for solutions to y^2 = x^3 + 7 only for integers in Fp. In other words, we use every x value in Fp (integers from 0 to (p-1)) and solve y^2 = x^3 + 7 for y. If y is also in Fp, then this (x, y) pair is a solution to the equation.
      </p>

      <p>
      (0,0) (0,1) ... (0,p-1)
      (1,0) .........
      ...............
      ...............
      ...............
      (p-1,0)........ (p-1,p-1)
      </p>

      <p>
      As you can imagine, an elliptic curve plotted over a prime field looks significantly different than an elliptic curve plotted over the real numbers. A prime field contains a finite number of elements, so instead of a continuous line, we see a scattering of dots.
      </p>

      <p>
      Here is why:
      </p>

      <p>
      The set of points in the prime field Fp looks like this. The x and y coordinates each range from 0 to (p-1):
      </p>

      <p>
      Not every element in the prime field will result in a solution to the elliptic curve equation (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b).
      </p>

      <p>
      Taking each one of these points and plugging them into our elliptic curve equation (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b) we see which ones will yeild solutions. Those that do will be included in the graph of the elliptic curve over the prime field.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note, for every point (x,y) that is a solution to the elliptic curve, the  corresponding point (x, -y modp) is also a solution! This is because y^2 == (-y)^2 mod p.
      </p>

      <p>
      Below, pictured is an elliptic curve graphed over a prime field. You can see that for each x which yeilds a solution to the curve modp, there is also another corresponding point for the same x! These pairings are reflections of eachother over the line y=p/2, i.e. the graph is symmetric about the line y=p/2.
      </p>

      <p>
      3.) How does elliptic curve addition work over a prime field?
